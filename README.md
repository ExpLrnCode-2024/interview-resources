# Interview resources

This repository contains resources created in preparation for the student interviews conducted during the [Experiences of Learning to Code](https://github.com/ExpLrnCode-2024) project.

There are two documents, both in the Markdown (`.md`) format.

1. `instructions.md`: This document contains step-by-step instructions for conducting 1-1 interviews with students over Microsoft Teams, from the point of first contact via email, all the way through to the redaction and formatting of the transcript.

2. `interview_guide.md`: This was used _during_ the interviews, by the interviewer (on a second screen). Note that these were _semi-structured_ interviews and hence this served as a loose guide and _not_ a protocol.

The most convenient way to view these documents is via the [GitHub Pages site](https://ExpLrnCode2024.github.io) for the project.
